      <Description title='About'>
        As a frontend developer, I focus on simplifying processes and automating
        routine tasks. I prioritize staying updated on security and best
        practices, while continuously seeking out opportunities to expand my
        knowledge and learn new skills.

      <Description title='Interests'>
        Outside of coding, I have a strong passion for badminton. I enjoy the
        fast-paced nature of the sport, which helps me stay active and sharp,
        both physically and mentally. Itâ€™s a great way to unwind and challenge
        myself to improve my skills.
